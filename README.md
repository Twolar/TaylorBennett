# Personal Website for Taylor Bennett
- As of 12/09/2019, website is very close to being deployed. From here, I will use more branching to practice utilising Development -> Testing -> Live process, when adding new features to the Live site.


### Built using:
- ASP.NETCORE
- SQLITE
- RAZOR PAGES
- CSS (BOOTSTRAP)
- HTML

- Backend service is an API that serves the data for Blogposts (utilises SQLite for its DB).
- Portfolio page pulls from two different APIs, first is github, where the website grabs a list of all public repositories. 
- Second API call gets README for each repository and displays it.
