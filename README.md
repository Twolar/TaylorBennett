# Personal Website for Taylor Bennett
- As of 12/09/2019, website is very close to being deployed. From here, I will use more branching to practice utilising Development -> Testing -> Live process, when adding new features to the Live site.  

- Has login capability, there is also capability for users to be an admin (currently only allows one, which is my login). Admin priveleges reveal the option to and allow you to create new and edit blog posts.
- Backend service is an API that serves the data for Blogposts (utilises SQLite for its DB).  
- Portfolio page pulls from two different APIs, first is github, where the website grabs a list of all public repositories. 
- Second API call gets README for each repository and displays it.


### Built using:
- ASP.NETCORE 2.2
- SQLITE
- RAZOR PAGES
- CSS (BOOTSTRAP)
- HTML
