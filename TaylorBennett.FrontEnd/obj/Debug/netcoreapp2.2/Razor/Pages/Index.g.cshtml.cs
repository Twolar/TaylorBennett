    <p> 
        My name is Taylor Bennett and I am 24 year old who is currently based on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand.

        <br><br>Since a young age I have always been naturally curious person who is  fascinated with technology, psychology and sports. 
        I grew up playing games on computer and alongside this I played rugby and had a love for golf. I eventually gave up rugby to put more 
        focus on golf, which led to me trying to pursue it as a profession for a couple of years. These couple of years I treated as gap years, 
        to which I had decided at age 20 I would attend university. With me deciding to study a Major in Business Psychology with a Minor in 
        Computer Science. 
        
        <br><br>I picked Business Psychology as a major due to when I was playing golf. Golf is a hi");

        vs yourself and the course, accompanied with this is the discipline and hard work it takes to develop and refine skills. This led to a 
        fascination with understanding psychological aspects of others and I, in order to hopefully be able to efficiently learn and improve myself 
        but it also helps with trying to do the same for others through the means of teaching. I picked the business focused aspect of psycology, 
        as I knew I would be heading into the business world, so having the psychology tailored more towards that will hopefully help me now 
        and in the future. 
        
        <br><br>The reason why I picked Computer Science is due to computers being a big part of my life growing up and I always had a
        fascination with how it and things on it worked. This led to me always trying to figure how these things worked, which was normally 
        done through playing with it, breaking it or trying to fix it. When beginning to l");

        that I really enjoyed it, as I enjoy solving problems and understanding how thing work.
        


        This curiosity of technology naturally led me to taking a computer science minor at university 
        I like the challenges that the career presents, as I consider myself as someone who loves to constantly learn and evolve so software/web development presents a good opportunity to explore that!

        <br><br>Software development also combines three areas of interest, with the first being obviously the technical side of things. 
        Then the second being the human and logistical side of it, with how the processes and collaboration between people come together 
        to hopefully produce successful software. Lastly, the third being the business aspect, which relates to the combination of the 
        first two, with successful software hopefully being produced, which is also profitable, but also serves a purpose and provides value

        <br><br>Currently, I am finishing my final paper at university via distance learning, the paper is based on software development. 
        Alongside this, I have been teaching and exposing myself to different aspects of software/web development in order to learn. 
        Specifically, aspects such as SQL, .NetCore, VanillaJS, CSS & HTML.

        <br><br>During my time at university, I have completed projects for my Computer Science Minor, which can be found on my Github. 
        We utilized C, C++ and Java to build these projects.

        <br><br>First, I think I will bring value through natural curiosity, as I tend to ask a lot of questions, 
        especially if I don't understand something. Second would be how eager I am to learn, which relates back to the natural 
        curiosity mentioned.

        <br><br>Due to my area of study aligning with what I am genuinely interested in. I believe I can bring an interesting combination
