    <p>
        My name is <strong>Taylor Bennett</strong> and I am 24 year old who is currently based on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand.

        <br><br>Since a young age I have always been naturally curious person who is  fascinated with technology, psychology and sports.
        I grew up playing games on computer and alongside this I played rugby and had a love for golf. I eventually gave up rugby to put more
        focus on golf, which led to me trying to pursue it as a profession for a couple of years. These couple of years I treated as gap years,
        to which I had decided at age 20 I would attend university and study a Major in Business Psychology with a Minor in
        Computer Science.

        <br><br> About a year before I started university, I began working at an organisation call");
            WriteLiteral(@"ed Benefitz with whom specialise in Print, Design
        and Advertising. Here my role was that of a part time student, to which I was exposed to many different areas of the business. Notably, I
        gained skill and experience by undertaking projects in the following areas: online print store management/admin, print work flow management, logic configurations 
        using Microsoft Flow, IT, inventory Management, print machine operation, LED advertising screens and accompanied software, delivery driving 
        and sign writing.

        <br><br>At university, I picked Business Psychology as a major due to when I was playing golf. Golf is a game that requires mental resilience as it is you
        vs yourself and the course, accompanied with this is the discipline and hard work it takes to develop and refine skills. This led to a
        fascination with understanding psychological aspects of others and I, in order to hopefully be able to efficiently learn and improve myself
        (not just ");
            WriteLiteral(@"in golf) but it also helps with trying to do the same for others through the means of teaching. I picked the business focused
        aspect of psycology, as I knew I would be heading into the business world, so having the psychology tailored more towards that will hopefully help me now
        and in the future.

        <br><br>The reason why I picked Computer Science is due to computers always being a big part of my life growing up and I always had a
        fascination with how it and things on it worked. Which was normally discovered through playing with it, breaking it or trying to fix it.
        When I began learning programming at university I quickly discovered that I really enjoyed it, as solving problems appeals to me and it
        also presents a chance for me to learn how things work under the hood, which satisfies my curiosity. So essentially, software development
        presents challenges that I like as I am someone who loves to constantly solve problems, learn and improve.

     ");
            WriteLiteral(@"   <br><br>Software development also combines three areas of interest, with the first being obviously the technical side of things.
        Then the second being the human and logistical side of it, this being how processes and the collaboration between people come together
        to hopefully produce successful software. And lastly, the third being the business aspect, which relates to the combination of the
        first two, with successful software hopefully being produced, which is profitable for both parties, but also serves a purpose by solving a
        problem and therefore provides real value to the market and customer in some degree.

        <br><br><strong>Currently</strong>, I am still involved in sports and I play in a 11 aside winter football (soccer) with a bit of casual
        golf on the side. I am also finishing my final paper at university via distance learning and the paper is based on processes in
        software development. Alongside this, I have been working on personal pr");

        <br>I believe I can bring an interesting combination to the table with the knowledge/experience I already have, but also the knowledge
        I seek to learn, in relation to the technical side of software/web development, but also in the human & business side of things. This is
        due to a high level of curiosity and the motivation to learn and improve.
